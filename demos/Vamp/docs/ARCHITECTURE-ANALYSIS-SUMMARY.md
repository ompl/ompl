- Two-phase initialization enables proper error handling
- Dependency injection promotes testability and flexibility
- Comprehensive error reporting with actionable messages

**Architecture Insight:** The facade successfully abstracts the complexity of coordinating OMPL's planning algorithms with VAMP's vectorized collision detection, providing a clean API that doesn't expose implementation details.

#### Adapter Pattern Implementation (OMPLPlanningContext)
**Strengths:**
- Maintains full OMPL compatibility without source modifications
- Clean translation between OMPL and VAMP configuration formats
- Encapsulates OMPL-specific setup logic
- Supports runtime planner factory registration

**Architecture Insight:** This adapter enables seamless integration with any OMPL-compatible planner while leveraging VAMP's performance optimizations transparently.

#### Registry Pattern Implementation (RobotRegistry)
**Strengths:**
- Type erasure (`std::any`) provides runtime polymorphism
- Compile-time type safety through template specialization
- Automatic registration minimizes user burden
- Plugin-compatible architecture for future extensions

**Architecture Insight:** The registry pattern successfully solves the tension between type safety and runtime flexibility, enabling string-based robot selection without sacrificing performance or correctness.

### Performance Architecture

#### SIMD Vectorization Strategy
**Technical Excellence:**
- **Memory Layout Transformation**: AOS → SOA conversion optimized for SIMD
- **Parallel Processing**: 8 configurations processed simultaneously
- **Cache Optimization**: Spatial locality in collision geometry access
- **Zero-allocation Hot Paths**: Function-local static buffers eliminate memory overhead

**Innovation:** The "rake" motion validation approach is particularly innovative, distributing temporal samples across SIMD lanes for parallel motion checking rather than traditional sequential validation.

### Integration Architecture

#### OMPL Integration Strategy
**Approach:** The integration maintains complete OMPL API compatibility while transparently providing SIMD acceleration through custom validators.

**Benefits:**
- Any OMPL planner works immediately with VAMP
- No modifications required to existing OMPL code
- Performance improvements are transparent to planning algorithms
- Benchmarking infrastructure generates standard OMPL-compatible results

#### Configuration System Design
**Hierarchical Structure:**
```
PlanningConfiguration (User Interface)
├── PlanningConfig (Algorithm Parameters)
├── RobotConfig (Joint Limits, Default Poses)
├── EnvironmentFactory (Obstacle Management)
└── VisualizationConfig (Output Formatting)
```

**Validation Strategy:** Early validation with comprehensive error messages providing actionable feedback for configuration issues.

### Type Safety Architecture

#### Template-Based Type System
**Compile-time Safety:**
- Robot interfaces validated through SFINAE constraints
- Template specialization for robot-specific optimizations
- Static assertions for interface compliance
- Constexpr computations for zero-cost abstractions

**Runtime Flexibility:**
- `std::any` type erasure for polymorphic behavior
- String-based robot selection for configuration systems
- Factory patterns for runtime planner creation
- Registry lookup for available robot types

### Benchmarking Infrastructure

## Architectural Strengths

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each component has a clear, focused responsibility:
- **VampOMPLPlanner**: Integration coordination
- **OMPLPlanningContext**: OMPL adaptation
- **VampValidators**: SIMD collision detection
- **RobotRegistry**: Type management
- **PlannerFactory**: Runtime planner creation

### 2. Open/Closed Principle
The architecture is open for extension without modification:
- New robots added via registration macros
- New planners registered through factory functions
- New environments implemented via factory interface
- Core system remains unchanged for extensions

### 3. Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations:
- VampOMPLPlanner depends on RobotConfig interface
- Planning algorithms depend on validation interfaces
- Registry pattern abstracts concrete robot types
- Factory patterns abstract concrete implementations

### 4. Interface Segregation
Interfaces are focused and cohesive:
- RobotConfig provides only robot-specific information
- EnvironmentFactory focuses on collision environment creation
- StateValidator and MotionValidator have specific collision responsibilities
- Clear separation between configuration and operational interfaces
