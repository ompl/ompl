* Expose OpenDE extension through Python bindings.

* Make PlannerData use BGL
  -- and add more functionality that deals with planner data;
  -- make sure PlannerData can be used easily to access the start & goal states that were extracted from the planner
  -- use PlannerData as "start states" in PlannerDefinition


* Add an implementation of a DiscreteControlSpace (analogous to DiscreteStateSpace)

* Add a function to StatePropagator such as this:

  /** \brief Compute the control that can take the system from state \e from to state \e to. 
    Store that control in \e result; the duration for which the control should be applied is stored in \e duration;
    return true if the computation was successful; return false otherwise; 

    \note If false is returned, the content of \e result and \e duration may have been changed,
    but it does not represent a solution; */

  bool steer(const base::State *from, const base::State *to, Control *result, double &duration) const
  {
     return false;
  }
 
* Start another 'concept' for ompl -- something that has algorithms for the analysis of spaces to plan in: Identify good lengths of path segments, good discretizations of control sets, automatic setting of parameters (projection cell sizes?), identification of good random projections
