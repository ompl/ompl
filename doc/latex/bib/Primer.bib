@inproceedings{Brin:1995,
    Abstract = {Given user data, one often wants to find approximate matches in a large database. A good example of such a task is finding images similar to a given image in a large collection of images. We focus on the important and technically difficult case where each data element is high dimensional, or more generally, is represented by a point in a large metric space- and distance calculations are computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce a data structure to solve this problem called a GNAT - Geometric Near-neighbor Access Tree. It is based on the philosophy that the data structure should act as a hierarchical geometrical model of the data as opposed to a simple decomposition of the data that does not use its intrinsic geometry. In experiments, we find that GNAT's outperform previous data structures in a number of applications.},
