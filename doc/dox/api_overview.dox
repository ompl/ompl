The class ownership diagram above shows the relationship between the essential base classes in OMPL. For example, @b SpaceInformation owns a @b StateManifold; @b Planner does @e not own @b SpaceInformation, although a @b Planner does know about the @b SpaceInformation, and uses provided functionality. Users are encouraged to use the SimpleSetup class (ompl::geometric::SimpleSetup or ompl::control::SimpleSetup). With this class, it is only necessary to instantiate a ompl::base::StateManifold object, a ompl::control::ControlManifold object (when planning with differential constraints, i.e, planning with controls), and a ompl::base::StateValidityChecker object. Many common state spaces have already been implemented as derived StateManifold classes. See a list \ref availableManifolds "here". 

The ompl::base::StateValidityChecker is problem-specific, so no default implementation is available. See \ref stateValidation "this document" for more information on state validity checking. For more advanced definitions of goals, see \ref goalRepresentation "this document".


\par Thread safety
All static, non-member or const member functions are thread
safe. Calling member functions that are not const in multiple
threads simultaneously is unsafe and locks should be used.

\par Memory management
For all base classes @b Class, a @b ClassPtr type is defined as
well. @b ClassPtr is in fact a <a
href="http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Boost_shared_pointers">boost
shared pointer</a> for @b Class :
@code
class Class;
typedef boost::shared_ptr<Class> ClassPtr;
@endcode
The code above is generated by the ClassForward macro defined in ompl/util/ClassForward.h:
@code
ClassForward(Class);
@endcode
Often the user is required to operate with @b _Ptr variables, in order
to ensure all memory is freed at the termination of the program
without explicitly calling \c delete. For some classes internal to the
library, a C-style pointer is maintained instead of the @b _Ptr
variable to avoid cyclic dependencies (which prevent memory
de-allocation).
