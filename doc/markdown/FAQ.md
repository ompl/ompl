# Frequently Asked Questions

- Q: _Why are the Python bindings not built?_

  __Short answer (most likely case)__: after running \c cmake, type “<tt>make update_bindings</tt>”.

  __Long answer__: the bindings are automatically generated by a script. You may not have all dependencies correctly installed (or detected by cmake). Check the pages [Installation](installation.html) and [Updating Python Bindings](python.html#updating_python_bindings) for details on installing dependencies and the individual steps involved in creating Python bindings, respectively.

- Q: _Why is the code I added to the OMPL source not being compiled?_

  See [the OMPL Build System](buildSystem.html). Essentially, just run \c cmake again after adding new files.

- Q: _How do I specify collision checking for a planner?_

  A: See [page on state validation](stateValidation.html).

- Q: _Can I visualize the exploration datastructure used by a planner?_

  A: Yes. You need to call ompl::base::Planner::getPlannerData(). This will give you an instance of ompl::base::PlannerData which contains all the states and the edges between them. The PlannerData can be exported in [GraphML format](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org) which can be read by a number of external programs such a [graph-tool](http://graph-tool.skewed.de) and [Gephi](http://gephi.github.io).

- Q: _Can I change the state space during planning?_

  A: No. Such changes will make the code crash.

- Q: _Can I set the sampler to use for a planner?_

  A: Yes. The sampler instances used by planners are allocated by either ompl::base::SpaceInformation::allocStateSampler() (which calls ompl::base::StateSpace::allocStateSampler() under the hood) or by ompl::base::SpaceInformation::allocValidStateSampler(). By default, ompl::base::SpaceInformation::allocValidStateSampler() produces an instance of ompl::base::UniformValidStateSampler, unless a sampler allocator was specified. The simplest way to change which sampler is allocated is to specify a sampler allocator. Calling ompl::base::SpaceInformation::setValidStateSamplerAllocator() allows the user to do just that:
  ~~~{.cpp}
  #include "ompl/base/samplers/ObstacleBasedValidStateSampler.h"
  ...
  ompl::base::ValidStateSamplerPtr allocValidStateSampler(const ompl::base::SpaceInformation *si)
  {
      return ompl::base::ValidStateSamplerPtr(new ompl::base::ObstacleBasedValidStateSampler(si));
  }
  ...
  ompl::base::StateSpacePtr space(...);
  ompl::base::SpaceInformationPtr si(new ompl::base::SpaceInformation(space));
  si->setValidStateSamplerAllocator(boost::bind(&allocValidStateSampler, _1));
  // for simplified calls, you can also use:
  // si->setValidStateSamplerAllocator(&allocValidStateSampler);
  ~~~

  The example above is similarly applicable for ompl::base::StateSamplerAllocator ompl::control::ControlSamplerAllocator, ompl::control::DirectedControlSamplerAllocator and ompl::base::PlannerAllocator.
