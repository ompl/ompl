This project is supported in part by NSF CCLI grant #0920721 and a generous gift from Willow Garage. The code is based on an older version of OMPL written by [Ioan È˜ucan](http://ioan.sucan.ro) while at Willow Garage. This project has also benefited from a number of other efforts:

- Previous efforts by the Kavraki lab to develop a motion planning software package. The Object-Oriented System for Motion Planning (OOPSMP) in particular provided significant inspiration in the design of OMPL. We are indebted to all other Kavraki lab members, past and present, for providing code, inspiration, and feedback. Previous work by [Erion Plaku](http://faculty.cua.edu/plaku/index.html), [Kostas Bekris](http://www.pracsyslab.org/bekris), and [Andrew Ladd](http://www.cse.unr.edu/robotics/tc-apc/andrew_ladd) in particular has been influential in the design of OMPL.
- Useful discussions with [Dr. Sachin Chitta](http://www.sachinchitta.org) and Dr. Gil Jones.
