# Multilevel Planning Framework {#multiLevelPlanning}

[TOC]

When dealing with high-dimensional motion planning problems, we often cannot
solve them directly because our algorithms either run out of memory or the
runtime quickly blows up. To combat this [curse of
dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), we can
instead plan on different levels of abstractions. To plan on different levels of
abstractions, we develop the multilevel planning framework. In this framework we
use internally the language of [Fiber
Bundles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_bundle) to model abstractions as
sequences of admissible lower-dimensional projections of the state space. 

## High-level introduction

Instead of planning on a single state space, we instead use a sequence of state
spaces, which allows a planner to exploit those spaces to quickly find
solutions. To use the multilevel planning framework, you only need to
specify a sequence of `ompl::base::SpaceInformationPtr` together with
corresponding `ompl::base::StateValidityChecker` functions. You can use any
sequence and any validiy checker you like. However, if you want to be sure that
the algorithm finds a solution, you need to make sure that those functions are
admissible. Admissible here means that if there exists a valid solution on the
original state space, and you project this solution onto a lower-dimensional
space in your sequence, then this solution must be feasible. In practice, you
can achieve admissibility by constraint relaxation operations, like shrinking
obstacles, shrinking links, removing non-holonomic constraints, removing links,
removing subsystems or removing robots (from a set of robots).

Some examples of admissible projections are shown in the Figure below. We show
three examples. In the first example, we remove the arms of PR2 (which might be
irrelevant when moving through long corridors). In the second
example, we remove some fingers of the Shadow hand which might not be relevant for a
particular grasp. In the third example, we nest an inscribed sphere in an
airplane. While the airplane might have non-holonomic constraints, the sphere is
holonomic. The validity checker in each case corresponds to checking collision
of the lower-dimensional robot.

## Why Use Multilevel Planning

- If you supply admissible projections, we can guarantee probabilistic completeness and asymptotical (near-) optimality
- It is more general than lower-dimensional projections
  - (1) We can handle a finite number of sequential projections instead of just one.
  - (2) We can project onto many manifold spaces instead of just euclidean
    space \f$\mathbb{R}^N\f$.
  - (3) We can handle multiple robots and non-holonomic constraints
- It can be much faster compared to other planning algorithms (on the order of
  several magnitudes)

## 100-dimensional Hypercube Benchmark

To see how much faster multilevel planning can be, we provide a 100 dimensional hypercube
demo, which you can run yourself using [Multilevel HyperCube](MultiLevelPlanningHyperCube_8cpp_source.html) and [Multilevel HyperCube Benchmark](MultiLevelPlanningHyperCubeBenchmark_8cpp_source.html).

The abstractions in this scenario are \f$99\f$ projections, where each
projection removes a dimension from the problem and reduces the problem from an
\f$N\f$-dimensional cube to an \f$N-1\f$ dimensional cube. We compare several
multilevel planning algorithms (QRRT, QRRT*, QMP, QMP*, SPQR) to all other
algorithms currently implemented in the library (as of May 2020). Note that we
had to remove planners `ompl::geometric::SST` and `ompl::geometric::PDST` due to
memory issues. We observe that QRRT, QRRT*, QMP and QMP* all terminate in under
one second (note that `ompl::multilevel::SPQR` and `ompl::geometric::SPARStwo`
terminate while declaring the problem to be infeasible). Thus the multilevel
planner significantly outperforms classical planner. Note that this problem is
really hard, and classical planner can often only solve this problem with up to $25$
dimensions in reasonable time. It seems using multilevel planning is the only
option to solve such challenging environments.
