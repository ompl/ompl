# ADR-001: SIMD Vectorization Strategy for Collision Detection

## Status
TBD

## Context
Motion planning requires intensive collision detection that typically dominates computational cost (60-80% of planning time). Traditional approaches check configurations sequentially, missing opportunities for parallel processing available in modern SIMD instruction sets.

## Decision
Implement vectorized collision detection using SIMD instructions to process 8 robot configurations simultaneously, transforming the fundamental collision checking paradigm from sequential to parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

### Memory Layout Transformation
- **From**: Array-of-Structures (AOS) - OMPL's native format
- **To**: Structure-of-Arrays (SOA) - SIMD-optimized format
- **Conversion**: Zero-copy transformation using function-local static buffer pools

### Vectorization Approach
1. **State Validation**: Fill all SIMD lanes with same configuration for consistency
2. **Motion Validation**: "Rake" sampling - distribute temporal samples across SIMD lanes
3. **Forward Kinematics**: Vectorized computation of all link poses simultaneously

### Robot-Specific Optimization
- Compile-time configuration per robot type
- Resolution parameter controls motion sampling density
- Sphere count and joint dimensions embedded in type system

## Consequences

### Positive
- **8x collision detection speedup** theoreticallys
- **~50% overall motion planning improvement** for collision-heavy scenarios on assumption
- Better CPU instruction pipeline utilization
- Cache-efficient memory access patterns
- Scalable to future SIMD instruction set extensions (AVX-512, ARM SVE)

### Negative
- Increased code complexity in conversion layer
- Memory alignment requirements for optimal performance
- Limited benefit for collision-sparse environments
- Robot dimension constraint (currently limited to 16 DOF by buffer size)

### Neutral
- Maintains OMPL interface compatibility
- No impact on planning algorithm selection
- Transparent to end users

## Implementation Notes
- Function-local static buffers eliminate allocation overhead in hot paths
- SFINAE templates ensure type safety at compile time

## Validation
- Benchmarked against scalar implementations
- Measured performance across different robot types and environments
