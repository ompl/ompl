# Available Planners

All implementations listed below are considered fully functional. Some of the newer planners are marked as *experimental*. An experimental planner is one that, despite passing our test suite, has not been used very often and issues may still exist (bugs or efficiency issues).

# Planning under geometric constraints

This set of planners only accounts for the geometric constraints of the system.  Infinite accelerations and velocities are assumed.
