         \todo The Python bindings for GoalLazySamples class are still broken.
         The OMPL C++ code creates a new thread from which you should be able
         to call a python Goal sampling function. Acquiring the right threads
         and locks and messing around with the Python Global Interpreter Lock
         (GIL) is very tricky. See ompl/py-bindings/generate_bindings.py for
         an initial attempt to make this work.

                lazy fashion. A function (\e samplerFunc) that
                produces samples from that region needs to be passed
                to this constructor. The sampling thread is
                automatically started if \e autoStart is true. The
                sampling function is not called in parallel by
                OMPL. Hence, the function is not required to be thread
                safe, unless the user issues additional calls in
                parallel. The instance of GoalLazySamples remains
                thread safe however.

                The function \e samplerFunc returns a truth value. If
                the return value is true, further calls to the
                function can be made. If the return is false, no more
                calls should be made. The function takes two
                arguments: the instance of GoalLazySamples making the
                call and the state to fill with a goal state. For
                every state filled in by \e samplerFunc,
                addStateIfDifferent() is called.  A state computed by
                the sampling thread is added if it is "sufficiently
                different" from previously added states. A state is
                considered "sufficiently different" if it is at least
