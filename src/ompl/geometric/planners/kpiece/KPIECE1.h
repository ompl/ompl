           @par Short description
           KPIECE is a tree-based planner that uses a discretization
           (multiple levels, in general) to guide the exploration of
           the continuous space. This implementation is a simplified
           one, using a single level of discretization: one grid. The
           grid is imposed on a projection of the state space. When
           exploring the space, preference is given to the boundary of
           this grid. The boundary is computed to be the set of grid
           cells that have less than 2n non-diagonal neighbors in an
           n-dimensional projection space.
           It is important to set the projection the algorithm uses
           (setProjectionEvaluator() function). If no projection is
           set, the planner will attempt to use the default projection
           associated to the state space. An exception is thrown if
           no default projection is available either.
