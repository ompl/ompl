           @par Short description
           \ref gFMT "FMT*" is an asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion
            planning algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to a shortest
            path solution. The algorithm is specifically aimed at solving complex
            motion planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces.
            The \ref gFMT "FMT*" algorithm essentially performs a lazy dynamic
            programming recursion on a set of probabilistically-drawn samples to
            grow a tree of paths, which moves steadily outward in cost-to-come space.

           @par Deviation from the paper
           The implementation includes a cache in the collision checking since the original
           algorithm could check the same collision more than once. It increases the
           memory requirements to O(n logn), but as samples tend to infinity this
           bound tend to O(n).

           It also implements the resampling strategy (extended FMT) included in the
           BiDirectional FMT* paper.
