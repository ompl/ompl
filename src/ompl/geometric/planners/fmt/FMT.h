           @par Short description
           \ref gFMT "FMT*" is an asymptotically-optimal sampling-based motion
            planning algorithm, which is guaranteed to converge to a shortest
            path solution. The algorithm is specifically aimed at solving complex
            motion planning problems in high-dimensional configuration spaces.
            The \ref gFMT "FMT*" algorithm essentially performs a lazy dynamic
            programming recursion on a set of probabilistically-drawn samples to
            grow a tree of paths, which moves steadily outward in cost-to-come space.
