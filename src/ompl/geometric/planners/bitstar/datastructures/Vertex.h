        @par Short description
        A class to store a state as a vertex in a (tree) graph.
        Allocates and frees it's own memory on construction/destruction.
        Parent vertices are owned by their children as shared pointers,
        assuring that a parent vertex will not be deleted while the child exists.
        Child vertices are owned by their parents as weak pointers, assuring
        that the shared-pointer ownership loop is broken.

        @par Note
        Add/Remove functions should almost always update their children's cost.
        The only known exception is when a series of operations are being performed
        and it would be beneficial to delay the update until the last operation. In this case,
        make sure that the last call updates the children and is on the highest ancestor that has been
        changed. Updates only flow downstream.
