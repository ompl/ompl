            \ref gBITstar "BIT*" (Batch Informed Trees) is an \e anytime asymptotically optimal sampling-based
            planning algorithm. It approaches problems by assuming that a \e simple solution exists and only
            goes onto consider \e complex solutions when that proves incorrect. It accomplishes this by using
            heuristics to search in order of decreasing potential solution quality.

            Both a k-nearest and r-disc version are available, with the k-nearest selected by default. In general,
            the r-disc variant considers more connections than the k-nearest. For a small number of specific planning
            problems, this results in it finding solutions slower than k-nearest (hence the default choice).
            It is recommended that you try both variants, with the r-disc version being recommended *if* it finds an
            initial solution in a suitable amount of time (which it probably will). The difference in this number of
            connections considered is a RGG theory question, and certainly merits further review.

            This implementation of BIT* can handle multiple starts, multiple goals, a variety of optimization objectives
            (e.g., path length), and with \ref gBITstarSetJustInTimeSampling "just-in-time sampling", infinite problem domains.
            Note that for some of optimization  objectives, the user must specify a suitable heuristic and that when
            this heuristic is not specified, it will use the conservative/always admissible \e zero-heuristic.

            This implementation also includes some new advancements, including the ability to prioritize exploration until an
            initial solution is found (\ref gBITstarSetDelayRewiringUntilInitialSolution "Delayed rewiring"), the ability to generate
            samples only when necessary (\ref gBITstarSetJustInTimeSampling "Just-in-time sampling"), and the ability to periodically
            remove samples that have yet to be connected to the graph (\ref gBITstarSetDropSamplesOnPrune "Sample dropping"). With
            just-in-time sampling, BIT* can even solve planning problems with infinite state space boundaries, i.e., (-inf, inf).

            \todo
            - Implement approximate solution support.
            - Make the k-nearest variant correct. Right now the search considers the k-nearest samples \e and the k-nearest vertices. It should find the combined k-nearest "samples & vertices".
