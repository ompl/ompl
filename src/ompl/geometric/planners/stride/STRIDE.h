          @par Short description
          STRIDE (Search Tree with Resolution Independent Density Estimation)
          is a tree-based motion planner that attempts to detect
          the less explored area of the space through the use of a
          GNAT nearest-neighbor data structure. It is similar to EST,
          but unlike the EST implementation in OMPL does not require
          a projection. However, in case the state space has many
          dimensions, a projection can be specified and the GNAT
          can be built using distances in the projected space. This
          has the advantage over the EST implementation that no grid
          cell sizes have to be specified.
