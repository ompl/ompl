        \ref gBITstar "BIT*" (Batch Informed Trees) is an \e anytime asymptotically optimal sampling-based planning
        algorithm. It approaches problems by assuming that a \e simple solution exists and only goes onto consider \e
        complex solutions when that proves incorrect. It accomplishes this by using heuristics to search in order of
        decreasing potential solution quality.

        Both a k-nearest and r-disc version are available, with the k-nearest selected by default. In general, the
        r-disc variant considers more connections than the k-nearest. For a small number of specific planning problems,
        this results in it finding solutions slower than k-nearest (hence the default choice). It is recommended that
        you try both variants, with the r-disc version being recommended *if* it finds an initial solution in a suitable
        amount of time (which it probably will). The difference in this number of connections considered is a RGG theory
        question, and certainly merits further review.

        This implementation of BIT* can handle multiple starts, multiple goals, a variety of optimization objectives
        (e.g., path length), and with \ref gBITstarSetJustInTimeSampling "just-in-time sampling", infinite problem
        domains. Note that for some of optimization  objectives, the user must specify a suitable heuristic and that
        when this heuristic is not specified, it will use the conservative/always admissible \e zero-heuristic.

        This implementation also includes some new advancements, including the ability to prioritize exploration until
        an initial solution is found (\ref gBITstarSetDelayRewiringUntilInitialSolution "Delayed rewiring"), the ability
        to generate samples only when necessary (\ref gBITstarSetJustInTimeSampling "Just-in-time sampling"), and the
        ability to periodically remove samples that have yet to be connected to the graph (\ref
        gBITstarSetDropSamplesOnPrune "Sample dropping"). With just-in-time sampling, BIT* can even solve planning
        problems with infinite state space boundaries, i.e., (-inf, inf).
