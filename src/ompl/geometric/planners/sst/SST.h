           @par Short description
           \ref gSST "SST" (Stable Sparse RRT) is an asymptotically near-optimal incremental
           sampling-based motion planning algorithm. It is recommended for geometric problems
           to use an alternative method that makes use of a steering function. Using SST for
           geometric problems does not take advantage of this function.
