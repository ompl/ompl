        /// (ompl::geometric::PathSimplifier) and hybridization
        /// (ompl::geometric::PathHybridization) to a set of solution paths
        /// with the goal of rapidly converging to a solution with

        /// until the termination condition is met.

        /// algorithms. This implementation deviates from the published
        /// version. Here, n threads repeatedly produce solution paths
