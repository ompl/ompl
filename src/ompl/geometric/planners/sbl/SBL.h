           @par Short description
           SBL is a tree-based motion planner that attempts to grow two
           trees at once: one grows from the starting state and the other
           from the goal state. The tree expansion strategy is the same as for \ref gEST "EST".
           Attempts are made to connect these trees
           at every step of the expansion. If they are connected, a
           solution path is obtained. However, this solution path is not
           certain to be valid (the lazy part of the algorithm) so it is
           checked for validity. If invalid parts are found, they are
           removed from the tree and exploration of the state space
           continues until a solution is found.
           To guide the exploration, an additional grid data
           structure is maintained. Grid cells contain states that
           have been previously visited. When deciding which state to
           use for further expansion, this grid is used;
           least-filled grid cells have most chances of being selected. The
           grid is usually imposed on a projection of the state
           space. This projection needs to be set before using the
           planner (setProjectionEvaluator() function). Connection of states in different trees is
           attempted if they fall in the same grid cell. If no projection is
           set, the planner will attempt to use the default projection
           associated to the state space. An exception is thrown if
           no default projection is available either.
