           @par Short description
           PDST is a tree-based motion planner that attempts to detect
           the less explored area of the space through the use of a
           binary space partition of a projection of the state space.
           Exploration is biased towards large cells with few path
           segments. Unlike most tree-based planners which expand from
           a randomly select endpoint of a path segment, PDST expands
           from a randomly selected point along a deterministically
           selected path segment. It is important to set the projection
           the algorithm uses (setProjectionEvaluator() function). If
           no projection is set, the planner will attempt to use the
           default projection associated to the state space. An
           exception is thrown if no default projection is available
           either.
