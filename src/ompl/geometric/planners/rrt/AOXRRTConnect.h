           @par Short description
           AORRTC leverages RRT-Connect to repeatedly search
           in a cost-augmented space, which is slowly constrained
           to force the planner to iteratively find better
           solutions. This modified RRT-Connect performs
           its search in the configuration space of the robot
           with an added cost dimension, and finds higher quality
           solutions than its current best solution by only
           allowing connections that could result in an improved
           solution. This is done by sampling a cost for each new
           sample uniformly from a range that is both reachable
           and can improve upon the current solution, and uses
           this sampled cost as an upper bound for the cost of
           connections to this sample/
