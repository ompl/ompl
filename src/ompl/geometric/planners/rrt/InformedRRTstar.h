            Run \ref gRRTstar "RRT*" with an informed search strategy that uses heuristics to only consider subproblem
           that could provide a better solution.
            The search is limited to this subproblem by pruning the graph, generating samples only in this subproblem
           (directly if available, e.g., \ref gPathLengthDirectInfSampler "path length")
            and, when available, using the measure of this subproblem to calculate the connection terms (e.g., path
           length)
