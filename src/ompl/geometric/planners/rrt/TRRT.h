           @par Short description
           T-RRT is an RRT variant and tree-based motion planner that takes into consideration state costs
           to compute low-cost paths that follow valleys and saddle points of the configuration-space
           costmap. It uses transition tests from stoachastic optimization methods to accept or reject new
           potential sates.
           @par Example usage
           Please see <a href="https://github.com/davetcoleman/ompl_rviz_viewer/">Dave Coleman's example</a> to see how TRRT can be used.
