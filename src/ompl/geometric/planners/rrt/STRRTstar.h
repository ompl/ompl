           @par Short description
           ST-RRT* is a bidirectional, time-optimal planner for planning in space-time.
           It operates similar to a bidirectional version of RRT*, but allows planning in unbounded time spaces by
           gradual time-bound extensions and is highly optimized for planning in space-time by employing
           Conditional Sampling and Simplified Rewiring.
