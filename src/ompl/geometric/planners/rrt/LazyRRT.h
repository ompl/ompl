           @par Short description
           RRT is a tree-based motion planner that uses the following
           idea: RRT samples a random state @b qr in the state space,
           then finds the state @b qc among the previously seen states
           that is closest to @b qr and expands from @b qc towards @b
           qr, until a state @b qm is reached. @b qm is then added to
           the exploration tree.
           The difference between \ref gRRT "RRT" and LazyRRT is that when moving
           towards the new state @b qm, LazyRRT does not check to make
           sure the path is valid. Instead, it is optimistic and
           attempts to find a path as soon as possible. Once a path is
           found, it is checked for collision. If collisions are
           found, the invalid path segments are removed and the search
           process is continued.
