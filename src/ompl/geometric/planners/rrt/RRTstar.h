           @par Short description
           \ref gRRTstar "RRT*" (optimal RRT) is an asymptotically-optimal incremental
           sampling-based motion planning algorithm. \ref gRRTstar "RRT*" algorithm is
           guaranteed to converge to an optimal solution, while its
           running time is guaranteed to be a constant factor of the
           running time of the \ref gRRT "RRT". The notion of optimality is with
           respect to the distance function defined on the state space
           we are operating on. See ompl::base::Goal::setMaximumPathLength() for
           how to set the maximally allowed path length to reach the goal.
           If a solution path that is shorter than ompl::base::Goal::getMaximumPathLength() is
           found, the algorithm terminates before the elapsed time.
