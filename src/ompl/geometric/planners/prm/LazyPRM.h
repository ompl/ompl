           @par Short description
           LazyPRM is a planner that constructs a roadmap of milestones
           that approximate the connectivity of the state space, just like PRM does.
           The difference is that the planner uses lazy collision checking.

             appropriate than an adjacency_matrix. We use listS for the vertex list
             because vertex descriptors are invalidated by remove operations if using vecS.

             @par Obviously, a ompl::base::State* vertex property is required.
             The incremental connected components algorithm requires
             vertex_predecessor_t and vertex_rank_t properties.
             If boost::vecS is not used for vertex storage, then there must also
             be a boost:vertex_index_t property manually added.
