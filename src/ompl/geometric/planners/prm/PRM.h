           @par Short description
           PRM is a planner that constructs a roadmap of milestones
           that approximate the connectivity of the state space. The
           milestones are valid states in the state space. Near-by
           milestones are connected by valid motions. Finding a motion
           plan that connects two given states is reduced to a
           discrete search (this implementation uses A*) in the
           roadmap.

             be a boost:vertex_index_t property manually added.
