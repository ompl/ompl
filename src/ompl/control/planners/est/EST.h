           @par Short description
           EST is a tree-based motion planner that attempts to detect
           the less explored area of the space through the use of a
           grid imposed on a projection of the state space. Using this
           information, EST continues tree expansion primarily from
           less explored areas.  It is important to set the projection
           the algorithm uses (setProjectionEvaluator() function). If
           no projection is set, the planner will attempt to use the
           default projection associated to the state space. An
           exception is thrown if no default projection is available
           either.
