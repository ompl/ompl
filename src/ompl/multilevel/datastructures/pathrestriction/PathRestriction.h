        /** \brief Representation of path restriction
            (union of fibers over a base path).

            Class represents path restriction by keeping a set of discrete base
            path states. To access states inbetween, we use the
            interpolateBasePath method. To find a feasible section over a path
            restriction, we use the strategy pattern FindSection, which has
            different implementations.

            To use this class, you need to set a base path (setBasePath), then
            you can search for sections over this base path (using
            hasFeasibleSection). Internally, this calls the FindSection
            algorithm, which can be changed in Constructor method. Please see
            the class ompl::multilevel::FindSection for details on finding
            feasible sections.
